# The way to recreate the Google Images in Drupal
This is a Drupal implementation of the way described by Dan Rose in publication [Recreating the Google Images Search Layout with CSS](https://www.sitepoint.com/recreating-google-images-search-layout-css).

*Project: Drupal 7, [views](https://www.drupal.org/project/views), [stanford_gallery](https://github.com/SU-SWS/stanford_gallery)*
 
You can see how it works on this [demo](http://dev-demoproject.pantheonsite.io/recreating-google-images-search-layout-drupal).
For implementation were used files [css](css.css) and [js](js.js). The markup is executed using global field of view "custom text" and displayed [here](html.html).
